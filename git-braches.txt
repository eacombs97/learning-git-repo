Branches can be used to have a second version of the same code to work with. This can be used with for example, when you code
is running production and shouldn't be changed while running or when more than one person is working on code at the same time.

Overall it's considered best practice to do all changes in branches.

-----------------------------------------
Branches can be made in the git provider or locally.

When working in a branch locally that specific branch can then be published to the git provider. When finished a pull request 
can be created. Locally one would merge the branch instead, but with bigger projects often a pull request is required. From 
here people can also give reviews to code. Once the pull request is completed the code becomes a part of the main branch.

It's best practice to delete the old branch afterwards. (Branches tend to be made for specific features or bugs as well.)

------------------------------------------
It is primarily in public or shared repositories you see branching a pull requests used.
