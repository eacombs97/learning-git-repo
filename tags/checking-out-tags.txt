Tags can be checked out, just like any commit.

The right way to checkout a tag is to create a branch from it.
This is done by doing the following commands:
git checkout -b new_branch v1.1

-----------------------
We can check out the tag directly but this has certain implications:
git checkout v1.1

This does not create a new branch, this moves the head to where the tag is.
If we start working from here it will create a detached HEAD State.

This is like being on  an unnamed branch so if we make any new commits, they 
will not belong to any branch. This especially becomes a problem when we switch 
to another branch, we will be left with a hard time getting back to those 
made after being in the detached HEAD state.

This can be fixed 1 of 3 ways.

-----------------------
WAY ONE:
Tag the commit at the end to find the attatched tag. This also helps keep git from garbage collecting it.

git tag temp

-----------------------
WAY TWO:
Create a branch from the detatched HEAD location. The head still needs to be reattatched 
to prevent more issues from occuring.

git branch temp_branch

----------------------
WAY THREE:
Create a new branch and reattatch the HEAD at the same time.

git checkout -b temp_branch
