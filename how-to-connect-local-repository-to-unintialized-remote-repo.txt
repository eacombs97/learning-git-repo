This is an example of changing a local repository to a git repository.

--------------------------------------
Use the command:
git init 
to intialize the empty repostiory from a folder into a local repostiory.

--------------------------------------
To make sure the files are commited to the local repostiory use the commands:
git add .
and 
git commit -m "initial commit"
to stage and commit the files within the local repostiory.

--------------------------------------
Now to add this to the remote repostiory use the command:
git remote add origin https://github.com/eacombs97/new-repo.git
to link it to the empty repository in github. From here they are now connected together.

If you use the push command here it will be confused because there are no branches. 

--------------------------------------
To set up the branch use the command:
git push --set-upstream origin main
