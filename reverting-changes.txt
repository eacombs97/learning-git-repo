If we make changes we don't want to keep, we can go back to a previous commit.

-----------------------
To remove staged files use the command:
git restore --staged <file>
when there are all files 

-----------------------
For unstaged items they can be deleted with the command
git restore <file>

-----------------------
To look back in git history, go to the git log.
From here checkout an older version by using the command:
git checkout <commitid>

This is helpful to see what's going on but not to make changes.

------------------------
To revert to an old state, use the command:
git log --oneline
This helps to make the history more readable.

To revert states entirely use the command:
git revert <commitid>

This shows in the history as well that a previous state was reverted back to.
