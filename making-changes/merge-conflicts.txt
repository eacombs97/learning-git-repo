Merge conflicts can happen when different people are working on the same file, specifically when you try to merge them 
and git doesn't understand which version it should keep.

These can also come up when it gets cnfused where you are in history or when you forget to move branches and are 
working on the wrong branch.

--------------------------------------
If I have changes in the remote and local repository I may need to pull changes from the remote repository first.
This can cause a merge conflict. This can be resolved in the merge editor or by the top options.
