A good commit message should describe what changes were applied.

Commit messages should be in present test so it is clear that it is that commit doing it.

Commit messages should be in a max of 50 characters. If that is not enough extra description can be added.

-------------------------
To create a multiline commit message:
git commit


This will open a place where multiple lines can be added as a commit message. You could do this in the following format for a message:
  subject and description

  reason why

--------------------------
Commit message convention:

  <type>(<optional scope>): <description>

  <optional body>

  <optional footer>
