When delting files the file and it's commit history is still stored by git.
Just delete the file then push the local repository changes to the remote repository.

-------------------------------
When a file is renamed, the original file will be shown as deleted and a new file will be shown as being created.
Once the changes have been staged it will understand the files are the same file with a different name.

To skip the staging area when renaming a file use the command:
git mv .\secondexample.txt anotherexample.txt

This will place it directly into the staging area.

-------------------------------
When moving files into folders it will show similarly to files being renamed.

-------------------------------
Git does NOT keep track of empty folders.
If you need a folder to be shown create a file called
.gitkeep
