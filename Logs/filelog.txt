Any files put into the .gitignore file will be ignored. Git knows to automatically ignore these.

You can also use regular expressions in the .gitignore file.

They are commonly used for logfiles or certain local configuration files.

-------------------------------------------
When I first use the command:
git status
it will show that two files with changes that are untracked.

-------
files or text can be added to .gitignore

Adding a file:
filelog.txt 

Adding a folder:
Logs/

Adding a file in a folder of a specific file type (txt):
Logs/*.txt
